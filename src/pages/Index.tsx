                You're the person people count on to deliver, solve, and manage the important stuff. But when the requests 
                never stop, even the most capable and committed person hits a breaking point.
              </p>
              <p>
                If saying "no" feels risky and you fear letting people down or jeopardizing your 
                hard-earned reputation, the cycle gets even more challenging to break.

              <p>
                <span className="text-book-red font-medium">The Good No</span> is a practical guide to setting boundaries in a world that doesn't seem 
                to understand the concept.
              </p>
              <p>
                With clearly defined techniques and real-world examples, it shows you how to stop 
                drowning in demands and start protecting your time as if it's the most valuable 
                thing in the world (which it is).
              </p>
              <p>
                Perfect for people who are stretched too thin but still weirdly attracted to the 
                idea of building a "do or die" reputation. <span className="italic">The Good No</span> helps you master the art of 
                prioritizing the right stuff, at the right time, for the right people. Especially for yourself.
